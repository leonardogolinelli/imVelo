### imVelo: interpretable multi-kinetic Velocity

A novel interpretable deep learning model and pipeline for predicting gene expression and gene program changes in developmental trajectories using sc-RNAseq data.

Created at Theis Lab - Helmholtz Munich for my MSc Thesis.

Repo needs to be refined: missing installation specifications \ API \ code clean up.

Please contact me if you plan to use any of this code at leogolinelli@gmail.com
