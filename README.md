A novel interpretable deep learning model and pipeline for predicting gene expression and gene program changes in developmental trajectories using sc-RNAseq data.

Created at Theis Lab - Helmholtz Munich for my MSc Thesis in Quantitative in Computational Biology @ Trento University (Italy).

Repo needs to be refined: missing installation specifications \ API \ code clean up.
